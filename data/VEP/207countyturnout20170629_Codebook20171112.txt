VARIABLES
All capital letters have been used for variable names to set them off.  They are always lower case in the dataset.  

YEAR
year data applies to

FIPS2
Census state plus county fips code.  Four or five digits, depending on the state.

In the case of counties (or county equivalents in VA) that have been combined together since 1970, with the exception of Kansas City, this is the FIPS code to just one of those combined areas.  
For Kansas City, we assigned an entirely new code that is not a Census code.  

States that had alterations to their counties in this dataset because of no significant changes to their county boundaries are as follows (see appendix below for full information about this).  
If states you are interested in aren't in the following list, treat fips2 as the Census fips code.  
AK (extensive changes)
KS
NM
SD
VA (extensive changes)

COUNTYNAME
Name of county.

TVOTE
Total number of votes in a county in the November election.

RVOTE
Total number of Republican votes for president in a county in the November election.

DVOTE
Total number of Democratic votes for president in a county in the November election.

VAP
Estimated voting age population in a county on July 1 of the year in question.  

PROBATIONERS
Estimated number of felon probationers in the county.  
Note that states that disenfranchise probationers only do so for felon probationers, and that the percentage of probationers who are felons varies greatly by state.
"0" is input is a state does not disenfranchise probationers.  

PAROLEES
Estimated number of parolees in the county
"0" is input is a state does not disenfranchise parolees.

INCAR
Estimated number of incarcerated felons

CVAPMISSPER
I'd have to look this up, but I think I know what it is.
Proportion of VAP in the county for whom an estimate of cvap is unavailable.  
Mean=.0000938 (i.e., one one hundreth of a percent), non-zero for 2255 cases out of 27,786 cases, mean=.001156 among those cases.
Only observed in 1992, 1996, 2000 and 2004.  

CVAPPER
Estimated proportion of voting age population that was a citizen on July 1 of the year in question.  

CVAP
Number of citizens of voting age computed from VAP and CVAPPER above.  

VEP
Estimaed number of voting eligible people in the county.

NCVAPPER
Estimated proportion of CVAP that is a naturalized citizen on July 1 of the year in question.  

BATTERIES OF AGE VARIABLES
Numerator: number of voting age people in the age category in question
Denominator: number of citizens of voting age in the county
Measured as a proportion.
So this is merely VAP data
I very much want to estimate the number of people in these age categories by race/Hispanic status, and gender
I believe these data apply to July 1 of the year in question, but I'd have to go into the code and verify this.  

BATTERIES OF RACE VARIABLES
Numerator: number of citizens of voting age with the race/Hispanic status in question, with estimates of probationers and parolees of that race/Hispanic status in the county subtracted out.  
Denominator: number of citizens of voting age in the county, with estimates of probationers and parolees in the county subtracted out.  
Measured as a proportion.
So this is somewhere between CVAP and VEP data.  
I believe these data apply to July 1 of the year in question, but I'd have to go into the code and verify this.  

VAPNOV
Estimated voting age population of county in November of year in question extrapolated from VAP measured on July 1.

CVAPNOV
Estimated citizen voting age population of county in November of year in question extrapolated from CVAP measured on July 1.

VEPNOV
Estimated voting eligible population of county in November of year in question extrapolated from VEP measured on July 1.  

TURNOUTVAP
Turnout as a proportion using voting age population as the demoninator.  
Computed by: TVOTE/VAPNOV

TURNOUTCVAP
Turnout as a proportion using Citizen voting age population as the demoninator.  
Computed by: TVOTE/CVAPNOV



APPENDIX: List of changes to county boundaries and how these were dealt with in the dataset.  

*This program creates a new variable, fips2, that alters fips codes so that one fips code
*applies to the same locale over time.  
*It also ensures that different locales that are given the same fips code are not compared over time
*by giving them a year suffix that differentiates them.  
*Once this code has been run on a file, the file has to be collapsed on all appropriate variables + fips2,
*deleting fips.
*Whenever possible, changes to past fips codes to make them compatible with currently existing fips codes 
*was done.  

*The code is made as comparable over time, which means that some locales that are currently separate from each other
*were combined so an uninterrupted time series could be created.  
*This especially influences VA, which had many cities split apart from counties in this time.
*It is possible to go in and alter the code to make uninterrupted time series within decades only, which would 
*enable more contemporary counties to look like they do today.  

*If a change was made in a year on July 1 or earlier, then the entire year is considered to have the change.
*This is because inter- and post-censal estimates are made for July 1.  

*The information was sorted so that all changes pertaining to one state were put into one place.  

*All commented out statements are from the source, except when "CK: " is put at the beginning of a line, meaning
*it is a comment from Carl Klarner.

*Source of information about county changes
*https://www.census.gov/geo/reference/county-changes.html

*The code that deals with Kansas City isn't from the above source.  

*By clicking on a year below you will see the substantial county changes that occurred during that decade. 
*Substantial county changes include all county boundary changes affecting an estimated population of 200 or more people, 
*changes of at least one square mile where no estimated population was provided and research indicated that the affected 
*population may have been 200 people or more, or "large" annexations of unpopulated territory (10 square miles or more).

*AL
*•	DeKalb County, Alabama (01-049):
*Name corrected from De Kalb County.
*CK: no changes required from the above

*AK
*•	Petersburg Borough, Alaska (02-195): 
*Created from part of former Petersburg Census Area (02-195) and part of Hoonah-Angoon Census Area (02-105) effective January 3, 2013; estimated population 3,203.
*•	Hoonah-Angoon Census Area, Alaska (02-105):
*Part taken to create new Petersburg Borough (02-195) effective January 3, 2013; estimated detached population: 1
*•	Prince of Wales-Hyder Census Area, Alaska (02-198):
*Prince of Wales-Hyder Census Area (02-198) added part of the former Petersburg Census Area (02-195) effective January 3, 2013; estimated added population 613.
*CK: Hoonah-Angoon doesn't have to be altered, because it only lost one person.  
*CK: Petersburg Borough does have to be altered, because it lost 613 people to Prince of Wales-Hyder.  
*CK: however, no changes are made here, because both of those entities come up again in the 2000s changes, and they are both part of the six 
*geographic areas that will become one large area.  

*•	Kusilvak Census Area, Alaska (02-158)
*Changed name and code from Wade Hampton Census Area (02-270) effective July 1, 2015.
*•	Wade Hampton Census Area, Alaska (02-270)
*Changed name and code to Kusilvak Census Area (02-158) effective July 1, 2015.

*2000s

*•	Hoonah-Angoon Census Area, Alaska (02-105):
*Created from the remainder of the former Skagway-Hoonah-Angoon Census Area (02-232) when the new Skagway Municipality (02-230) was created 
*effective June 20, 2007; population: 2,574.
*•	Skagway Municipality, Alaska (02-230):
*Created from part of the former Skagway-Hoonah-Angoon Census Area (02-232) effective June 20, 2007; boundaries are identical to Skagway census 
*subarea; population: 862. The remainder of the former Skagway-Hoonah-Angoon Census Area was established as the new Hoonah-Angoon Census Area (02-105).
*•	Skagway-Hoonah-Angoon Census Area, Alaska (02-232):
*Split to create Skagway Municipality (02-230) and Hoonah-Angoon Census Area (02-105), effective June 20, 2007.
*CK: Hoonah-Angoon is mentioned above in the 2010s, but since it wasn't altered there, there is no problem.  
*CK: this area is also influenced by changes in the 1990s, and what I do isn't hurt by that fact.
replace fips2=2232 if fips2==2230|fips2==2105
*CK: collapse necessary for the above.  

*•	Petersburg Census Area, Alaska (02-195):
*Created from the remainder of the former Wrangell-Petersburg Census Area (02-280) when the new Wrangell City and Borough was created 
*effective June 1, 2008; estimated population: 4,260.
*•	Prince of Wales-Hyder Census Area, Alaska (02-198):
*Created from the remainder of the former Prince of Wales-Outer Ketchikan Census Area (02-201) after part (Outer Ketchikan area) 
*was annexed by Ketchikan Gateway Borough (02-130) effective May 19, 2008, and part (Meyers Chuck area) included in the new Wrangell City 
*and Borough effective June 1, 2008; estimated population: 6,115.
*•	Wrangell City and Borough, Alaska (02-275):
*Created from part of the former Wrangell-Petersburg Census Area (02-280) and part of Prince of Wales-Outer Ketchikan Census Area (02-201) 
*(Meyers Chuck area) effective June 1, 2008; estimated population: 2,448. The remainder of the former Wrangell-Petersburg Census Area was 
*established as the new Petersburg Census Area (02-195) effective June 1, 2008.
*CK: there are six distinct geographic locales in all the above places.  The only way to get a continuous area is to combine all six together.
*CK: These are not places with large populations.  The new fips code will be 2999
*•	Prince of Wales-Outer Ketchikan Census Area, Alaska (02-201):
*Part (Outer Ketchikan area) annexed by Ketchikan Gateway Borough (02-130) and part (Meyers Chuck area) included in new Wrangell City and 
*Borough (02-275), remainder renamed Prince of Wales-Hyder Census Area (02-198) effective May 19, 2008.
*CK: dealt with above, no action necessary
*•	Wrangell-Petersburg Census Area, Alaska (02-280):
*Split to create part of Wrangell City and Borough (02-275) and all of Petersburg Census Area (02-195), effective June 1, 2008.
*CK: dealt with above, no action necessary.
*•	Ketchikan Gateway Borough, Alaska (02-130):
*Annexed a substantial portion of the former Prince of Wales-Outer Ketchikan Census Area (02-201), including most of the area known as Outer Ketchikan 
*effective May 19, 2008; estimated added population: 7. As a result, the remaining area of the former Prince of Wales-Outer Ketchikan Census Area was 
*renamed Prince of Wales-Hyder Census Area (02-198).
*CK: dealt with above, no further action necessary.
*CK: SUMMARY OF PLACES CHANGED BY THIS CODE

*•	Denali Borough, Alaska (02-068): 
*Created from part of the Yukon-Koyukuk Census Area (02-290) and an unpopulated part of the Southeast Fairbanks Census Area (02-240) 
*effective December 7, 1990; 1990 population: 1,682.

*Part taken to create the new Denali Borough (02-068) effective December 7, 1990; 1990 detached population: 1,682.
*CK: dealt with above, no action necessary.
replace fips2=2068 if fips2==2290|fips2==2240
*CK: collapse is necessary with the above, although one of the areas may not appear in a dataset because it has no population.

*•	Skagway-Hoonah-Angoon Census Area, Alaska (02-232): 
*Created from the remainder of the former Skagway-Yakutat-Angoon Census Area (02-231) when the new Yakutat City and Borough (02-282) 
*was created effective September 22, 1992; 1990 population: 3,679.
*•	Yakutat City and Borough, Alaska (02-282): 
*Created from part of the former Skagway-Yakutat-Angoon Census Area (02-231) effective September 22, 1992. The remainder of the former 
*Skagway-Yakutat-Angoon Census Area was established as the new Skagway-Hoonah-Angoon Census Area (02-232) effective September 22, 1992; 
*1990 population: 725.
*•	Skagway-Yakutat-Angoon Census Area, Alaska (02-231): 
*Split to create the Skagway-Hoonah-Angoon Census Area (02-232) and Yakutat City and Borough (02-282) effective September 22, 1992.
*CK: The Skagway-Hoonah-Angoon Census Area (02-232) is mentioned again above in the 2000s, but the code here is still appropriate.
*CK: The area split here, and then one of those sub-areas split in the 2000s.  So all three of those areas will become the same area.

*1970s

*Changes to County Equivalent Entities in Alaska
*•	The county equivalent entities in Alaska changed from Census Divisions in 1970 to Boroughs and Census Areas in 1980. 
*The inventory and boundaries of the Alaska county-level entities changed substantially during the decade.
*•	New entities created in Alaska are: Dillingham Census Area (02-070), North Slope Borough (02-185), and Valdez-Cordova Census Area (02-261).

*CK: None of these fips codes show up in the 1980 census, so there is no problem there.  
*CK: the number of fips codes went from 29 to 25 from 1970 to 1980.  
*CK: Did any fips code that exists in both 1970 and 1980 change the geographic locale to which it represents?
*CK: Dillingham Census Area (02-070) apparently did, since it is new, and a 02-070 existed in 1970.  
*CK: looking at population figures, it appears that the change occurred between 1979 and 1980.  
*replace fips2=20701980 if fips2==2070&year>1979
*CK: the above is the only place where I'd have a four-digit suffix on the fips code.  This will confuse other
*people looking at my work, and it isn't going to influence that much.  Ignore this problem.  
*CK: I can't deal with other possibilities now.

*•	Weld County, Colorado (08-123): 
*Part taken to create new Broomfield County (08-014) effective November 15, 2001; estimated detached population: 69.
*CK: Adams county had around 250k people in it in 2002.  
*CK: Boulder County had around 250k people in it in 2002.
*CK: jefferson county had around 500k people in it in 2002.
*CK: weld had around 200k people in it in 2002.

*Part annexed to Arapahoe County (08-005) effective July 28, 1980; estimated area one square mile with no estimated population.
*CK: I believe "no estimated population" means they estimate no one is there, so no action necessary for the last two lines.
*CK: there is a typo.  Denver County is fips=8031.  
*CK: however, since only 2500 people are involved, and this is denver, that isn't a large % change in the county, 
*so I'm ignoring this.

*Lost territory (Takoma Park city) to Montgomery County (24-031) effective July 1, 1997; 1990 detached population: 5,156.
*CK: looking at these counties, the number of people shifted is a very small percentage of both counties.  This can be ignored.
