# About this repository

Contains my (Michael DeCrescenzo's) code contributing to the Great Lakes Elections Project (Joyce Foundation/MIT Election Admin data project)

This project is currently a work in progress


# Building the data

This repository contains R source code to process data from the EAVS, CCES, SPAE, and so on.

Eventually there will be a single R file that controls the production of all results
